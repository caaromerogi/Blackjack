# Blackjack

## Starting ðŸš€
The Blackjack Game was developed using Javascript and using the node module "readline-sync" to get user input.

## How it works?
### Start asking to the user for a name

### Once you insert your name, you receive two cards, their sum and if is below 18 the program ask if you want another card

### If you receive another and the total sum is below 18, the program will continue asking you if want another until win or lose

### In case you win, you will receive a prize and it will be added to your prize bag

### If you decide to play again, you receive two cards again and continue the game until you win or lose

### As you can see in the nex image, the prize is accumulative

### In case you lose, you receive a different message and the accumulated prize that you have in that moment

### If you dom't want to play anymore the program shows the final prize and a goodbye message
